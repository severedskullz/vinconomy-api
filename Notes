Player installs Vinconomy
Player starts single player world, or joins server (assumes Admin/creative role)


If the player is playing on a single player server, or a MP server that just wishes to join the GLOBAL network
	Player with admin rights runs join command
		/vincon network join




Player creates account
	/vincon network register SeveredSkullz Password
Server receives UserRegistration request with player name, UUID, user name, password
Player creates network under account
	/vincon network create SeveredSkullz Password My Network
	/vincon network create Password My Network
Vintage Story sends request to server. Uses player that ran the command's UUID for lookup under which account to add it to if not provided

Server attempts to generate new Network Access Key key for new network
	Search repository for same key. If it exists, generate a new one.
	If the generation fails after 5 times, throw an error. (shouldn't ever happen)

Server creates account and sends back the new Network Access Key to the player
	This key is meant to be distributed to all servers wishing to join the network
	
Player runs command to join via the Network Access Key
	/vincon network join MyAccessKey
	/vincon network join        (Uses "GLOBAL" as access key)
	
If the network automatically accepts requests then
	Server will create a new Trade Network Node listing and generate an API Key for the server
	Server will send GUID and API Key to Vintage Story, which will populate the configuration file
	Game has now joined the network!
	
If the network does not automatically accept requests then
	Player must view each join request
		/vincon network pending
	Player will be shown the first pending requests and can either accept or reject
		/vincon network accept
		/vincon network reject
		/vincon network acceptall
		/vincon network rejectall

		
Player can check on their application by running the command
	/vincon network status
	This will print out the status of the network, whether or not a request is sent out and its status, as well as the name of the network if it has joined one
